.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBpam_setcred\fR
function is used to establish, maintain and delete the credentials of a user\. It should be called after a user has been authenticated and before a session is opened for the user (with
\fBpam_open_session\fR(3))\.
.PP
A credential is something that the user possesses\. It is some property, such as a
\fIKerberos\fR
ticket, or a supplementary group membership that make up the uniqueness of a given user\. On a Linux system the user\'s
\fIUID\fR
and
\fIGID\fR\'s are credentials too\. However, it has been decided that these properties (along with the default supplementary groups of which the user is a member) are credentials that should be set directly by the application and not by PAM\. Such credentials should be established, by the application, prior to a call to this function\. For example,
\fBinitgroups\fR(2)
(or equivalent) should have been performed\.
