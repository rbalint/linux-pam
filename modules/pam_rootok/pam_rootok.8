\fBpam_rootok\.so\fR [debug]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
pam_rootok is a PAM module that authenticates the user if their
\fIUID\fR
is
\fI0\fR\. Applications that are created setuid\-root generally retain the
\fIUID\fR
of the user but run with the authority of an enhanced effective\-UID\. It is the real
\fIUID\fR
that is checked\.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
In the case of the
\fBsu\fR(1)
application the historical usage is to permit the superuser to adopt the identity of a lesser user without the use of a password\. To obtain this behavior with PAM the following pair of lines are needed for the corresponding entry in the
\fI/etc/pam\.d/su\fR
configuration file:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
# su authentication\. Root is granted access by default\.
auth  sufficient   pam_rootok\.so
auth  required     pam_unix\.so
