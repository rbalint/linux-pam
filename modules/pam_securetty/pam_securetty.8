.SH "NAME"
pam_securetty - Limit root login to special devices
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 17
\fBpam_securetty\.so\fR [debug]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
pam_securetty is a PAM module that allows root logins only if the user is logging in on a "secure" tty, as defined by the listing in
\fI/etc/securetty\fR\. pam_securetty also checks to make sure that
\fI/etc/securetty\fR
is a plain file and not world writable\.
.PP
This module has no effect on non\-root users and requires that the application fills in the
\fBPAM_TTY\fR
item correctly\.
.PP
For canonical usage, should be listed as a
\fBrequired\fR
authentication method before any
\fBsufficient\fR
authentication methods\.
