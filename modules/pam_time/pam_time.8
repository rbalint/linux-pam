.SH "NAME"
pam_time - PAM module for time control access
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 12
\fBpam_time\.so\fR [debug] [noaudit]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The pam_time PAM module does not authenticate the user, but instead it restricts access to a system and or specific applications at various times of the day and on specific days or over various terminal lines\. This module can be configured to deny access to (individual) users based on their name, the time of day, the day of week, the service they are applying for and their terminal from which they are making their request\.

By default rules for time/port access are taken from config file

If Linux PAM is compiled with audit support the module will report when it denies access\.
