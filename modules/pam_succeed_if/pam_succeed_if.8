.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
pam_succeed_if\.so is designed to succeed or fail authentication based on characteristics of the account belonging to the user being authenticated\. One use is to select whether to load other modules based on this test\.
.PP
The module should be given one or more conditions as module arguments, and authentication will succeed only if all of the conditions are met\.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following
\fIflag\fRs are supported:
.PP
\fBdebug\fR
.RS 4
Turns on debugging messages sent to syslog\.
.RE

\fBuse_uid\fR
.RS 4
Evaluate conditions using the account of the user whose UID the application is running under instead of the user being authenticated\.
.RE
.PP
\fBquiet\fR
.RS 4
Don\'t log failure or success to the system log\.
.RE
.PP
\fBquiet_fail\fR
