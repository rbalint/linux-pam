\fBpam_mail\.so\fR [close] [debug] [dir=\fImaildir\fR] [empty] [hash=\fIcount\fR] [noenv] [nopen] [quit] [standard]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The pam_mail PAM module provides the "you have new mail" service to the user\. It can be plugged into any application that has credential or session hooks\. It gives a single message indicating the
\fInewness\fR
of any mail it finds in the user\'s mail folder\. This module also sets the PAM environment variable,
\fBMAIL\fR, to the user\'s mail directory\.
.PP
If the mail spool file (be it
\fI/var/mail/$USER\fR
or a pathname given with the
\fBdir=\fR
parameter) is a directory then pam_mail assumes it is in the
\fIMaildir\fR
format\.
