This module makes sure the calling process has its own session keyring rather
than using the default per-user session keyring.

The following words may be supplied as arguments to the module through the PAM
configuration scripts:

 (*) "force"

     This will cause the process's current session keyring to be replaced with
     a new one. If this isn't supplied, a session keyring will only be created
     if the process doesn't already have its own.

 (*) "revoke"

     If the module actually created a keyring, this will cause that keyring to
     be revoked on session closure.

 (*) "debug"

     This will cause the module to write some debugging information to the
     syslog.
