.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
The pam_keyinit PAM module ensures that the invoking process has a session keyring other than the user default session keyring\&.

.PP
The session component of the module checks to see if the process's session keyring is the user default, and, if it is, creates a new anonymous session keyring with which to replace it\&.

.PP
If a new session keyring is created, it will install a link to the user common keyring in the session keyring so that keys common to the user will be automatically accessible through it\&.

.PP
The session keyring of the invoking process will thenceforth be inherited by all its children unless they override it\&.

.PP
This module is intended primarily for use by login processes\&. Be aware that after the session keyring has been replaced, the old session keyring and the keys it contains will no longer be accessible\&.

.PP
This module should not, generally, be invoked by programs like \fIsu\fR, since it is usually desirable for the key set to percolate through to the alternate context\&. The keys have their own permissions system to manage this\&.

.PP
This module should be included as early as possible in a PAM configuration, so that other PAM modules can attach tokens to the keyring\&.

.PP
The keyutils package is used to manipulate keys more directly\&. This included in the Fedora Extras 5+ and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 U2+ and can also be obtained from:

.PP
 Keyutils : \fIhttp://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/keyutils/\fR 

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fBdebug\fR
Log debug information with \fBsyslog\fR(3)\&.

.TP
\fBforce\fR
Causes the session keyring of the invoking process to be replaced unconditionally\&.

.TP
\fBrevoke\fR
Causes the session keyring of the invoking process to be revoked when the invoking process exits if the session keyring was created for this process in the first place\&.

.SH "MODULE SERVICES PROVIDED"

.PP
Only the \fIsession\fR service is supported\&.

.SH "RETURN VALUES"

.TP
PAM_SUCCESS
This module will usually return this value

.TP
PAM_AUTH_ERR
Authentication failure\&.

.TP
PAM_BUF_ERR
Memory buffer error\&.

.TP
PAM_IGNORE
The return value should be ignored by PAM dispatch\&.

.TP
PAM_SERVICE_ERR
Cannot determine the user name\&.

.TP
PAM_SESSION_ERR
This module will return this value if its arguments are invalid or if a system error such as ENOMEM occurs\&.

.TP
PAM_USER_UNKNOWN
User not known\&.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

.PP
Add this line to your login entries to start each login session with its own session keyring: 

.nf

session  required  pam_keyinit\&.so
      
.fi
 

.PP
This will prevent keys from one session leaking into another session for the same user\&.
