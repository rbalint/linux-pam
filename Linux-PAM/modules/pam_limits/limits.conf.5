.SH "NAME"
limits.conf \- configuration file for the pam_limits module
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The syntax of the lines is as follows:
.PP

\fI<domain>\fR
\fI<type>\fR
\fI<item>\fR
\fI<value>\fR
.PP
The fields listed above should be filled as follows:
.TP 3n
\fB<domain>\fR
.RS 3n
.TP 3n
\(bu
a username
.TP 3n
\(bu
a groupname, with
\fB@group\fR
syntax. This should not be confused with netgroups.
.TP 3n
\(bu
the wildcard
\fB*\fR, for default entry.
.TP 3n
\(bu
the wildcard
\fB%\fR, for maxlogins limit only, can also be used with
\fI%group\fR
syntax.
.RE
.TP 3n
\fB<type>\fR
.RS 3n
.TP 3n
\fBhard\fR
for enforcing
\fBhard\fR
resource limits. These limits are set by the superuser and enforced by the Kernel. The user cannot raise his requirement of system resources above such values.
.TP 3n
\fBsoft\fR
for enforcing
\fBsoft\fR
resource limits. These limits are ones that the user can move up or down within the permitted range by any pre\-exisiting
\fBhard\fR
limits. The values specified with this token can be thought of as
\fIdefault\fR
values, for normal system usage.
.TP 3n
\fB\-\fR
for enforcing both
\fBsoft\fR
and
\fBhard\fR
resource limits together.
.sp
Note, if you specify a type of '\-' but neglect to supply the item and value fields then the module will never enforce any limits on the specified user/group etc. .

.TP 3n
\fBrtprio\fR

.RE
.PP
In general, individual limits have priority over group limits, so if you impose no limits for
\fIadmin\fR
group, but one of the members in this group have a limits line, the user will have its limits set according to this line.
.PP
Also, please note that all limit settings are set
\fIper login\fR. They are not global, nor are they permanent; existing only for the duration of the session.
.PP
In the
\fIlimits\fR
configuration file, the '\fB#\fR' character introduces a comment \- after which the rest of the line is ignored.
.PP
The pam_limits module does its best to report configuration problems found in its configuration file via
\fBsyslog\fR(3).
