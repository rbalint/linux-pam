.SH "NAME"
pam_wheel - Only permit root access to members of group wheel
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 13
\fBpam_wheel\.so\fR [debug] [deny] [group=\fIname\fR] [root_only] [trust] [use_uid]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The pam_wheel PAM module is used to enforce the so\-called
\fIwheel\fR
group\. By default it permits root access to the system if the applicant user is a member of the
\fIwheel\fR
group\. If no group with this name exist, the module is using the group with the group\-ID
\fB0\fR\.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fBdebug\fR
.RS 4
Print debug information\.
.RE
.PP
\fBdeny\fR
.RS 4
Reverse the sense of the auth operation: if the user is trying to get UID 0 access and is a member of the wheel group (or the group of the
\fBgroup\fR
option), deny access\. Conversely, if the user is not in the group, return PAM_IGNORE (unless
\fBtrust\fR
was also specified, in which case we return PAM_SUCCESS)\.
.RE
.PP
\fBgroup=\fR\fB\fIname\fR\fR
.RS 4
Instead of checking the wheel or GID 0 groups, use the
\fB\fIname\fR\fR
group to perform the authentication\.
.RE
.PP
\fBroot_only\fR
.RS 4
The check for wheel membership is done only\.
.RE
.PP
\fBtrust\fR
.RS 4
The pam_wheel module will return PAM_SUCCESS instead of PAM_IGNORE if the user is a member of the wheel group (thus with a little play stacking the modules the wheel members may be able to su to root without being prompted for a passwd)\.
.RE
.PP
\fBuse_uid\fR
.RS 4
The check for wheel membership will be done against the current uid instead of the original one (useful when jumping with su from one account to another for example)\.
.RE
.SH "MODULE SERVICES PROVIDED"
.PP
The
\fBauth\fR
and
\fBaccount\fR
services are supported\.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
PAM_AUTH_ERR
.RS 4
Authentication failure\.
.RE
.PP
PAM_BUF_ERR
.RS 4
Memory buffer error\.
.RE
.PP
PAM_IGNORE
.RS 4
The return value should be ignored by PAM dispatch\.
.RE
.PP
PAM_PERM_DENY
.RS 4
Permission denied\.
.RE
.PP
PAM_SERVICE_ERR
.RS 4
Cannot determine the user name\.
.RE
.PP
PAM_SUCCESS
.RS 4
Success\.
.RE
.PP
PAM_USER_UNKNOWN
.RS 4
User not known\.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
The root account gains access by default (rootok), only wheel members can become root (wheel) but Unix authenticate non\-root applicants\.
