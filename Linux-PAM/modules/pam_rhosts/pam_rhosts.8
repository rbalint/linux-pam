.SH "NAME"
pam_rhosts \- The rhosts PAM module
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 14
\fBpam_rhosts.so\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This module performs the standard network authentication for services, as used by traditional implementations of
\fBrlogin\fR
and
\fBrsh\fR
etc.
.PP
The authentication mechanism of this module is based on the contents of two files;
\fI/etc/hosts.equiv\fR
(or and
\fI~/.rhosts\fR. Firstly, hosts listed in the former file are treated as equivalent to the localhost. Secondly, entries in the user's own copy of the latter file is used to map "\fIremote\-host remote\-user\fR" pairs to that user's account on the current host. Access is granted to the user if their host is present in
\fI/etc/hosts.equiv\fR
and their remote account is identical to their local one, or if their remote account has an entry in their personal configuration file.
.PP
The module authenticates a remote user (internally specified by the item
\fIPAM_RUSER\fR
connecting from the remote host (internally specified by the item
\fBPAM_RHOST\fR). Accordingly, for applications to be compatible this authentication module they must set these items prior to calling
\fBpam_authenticate()\fR. The module is not capable of independently probing the network connection for such information.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 3n
\fBdebug\fR
Print debug information.
.TP 3n
\fBsilent\fR
Don't print informative messages.
.TP 3n
\fBsuperuser=\fR\fB\fIaccount\fR\fR
Handle
\fIaccount\fR
as root.
.SH "MODULE SERVICES PROVIDED"
.PP
Only the
\fBauth\fR
service is supported.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.TP 3n
PAM_AUTH_ERR
The remote host, remote user name or the local user name couldn't be determined or access was denied by
\fI.rhosts\fR
file.
.TP 3n
PAM_USER_UNKNOWN
User is not known to system.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
To grant a remote user access by
\fI/etc/hosts.equiv\fR
or
\fI.rhosts\fR
for
\fBrsh\fR
add the following lines to
\fI/etc/pam.d/rsh\fR:
