    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>

    <para>
      This module allows setup of private namespaces with polyinstantiated
      directories. Directories can be polyinstantiated based on user name
      or, in the case of SELinux, user name, sensitivity level or complete security context.  If an
      executable script <filename>/etc/security/namespace.init</filename>
      exists, it is used to initialize the namespace every time a new instance
      directory is setup. The script receives the polyinstantiated
      directory path and the instance directory path as its arguments.
    </para>

    <para>
      The <filename>/etc/security/namespace.conf</filename> file specifies
      which directories are polyinstantiated, how they are polyinstantiated,
      how instance directories would be named, and any users for whom
      polyinstantiation would not be performed.
    </para>

    <para>
      When someone logs in, the file <filename>namespace.conf</filename> is
      scanned where each non comment line represents one polyinstantiated
      directory with space separated fields as follows:
   </para>

    <para>
      <replaceable>polydir</replaceable> <replaceable> instance_prefix</replaceable> <replaceable> method</replaceable> <replaceable> list_of_uids</replaceable>
    </para>

    <para>
      The first field, <replaceable>polydir</replaceable>, is the absolute
      pathname of the directory to polyinstantiate. Special entry $HOME is
      supported to designate user's home directory. This field cannot be
      blank.
    </para>

    <para>
      The second field, <replaceable>instance_prefix</replaceable> is
      the string prefix used to build the pathname for the instantiation
      of &lt;polydir&gt;. Depending on the polyinstantiation 
      <replaceable>method</replaceable> it is then appended with
      "instance differentiation string" to generate the final
      instance directory path. This directory is created if it did not exist
      already, and is then bind mounted on the &lt;polydir&gt; to provide an
      instance of &lt;polydir&gt; based on the &lt;method&gt; column.
      The special string $HOME is replaced with the user's home directory,
      and $USER with the username. This field cannot be blank. 
      The directory where polyinstantiated instances are to be
      created, must exist and must have, by default, the mode of 000.  The
      requirement that the instance parent be of mode 000 can be overridden
      with the command line option <replaceable>ignore_instance_parent_mode</replaceable>
    </para>

    <para>
      The third field, <replaceable>method</replaceable>, is the method
      used for polyinstantiation. It can take 3 different values; "user"
      for polyinstantiation based on user name, "level" for 
      polyinstantiation based on process MLS level and user name, and "context" for
      polyinstantiation based on process security context and user name
      Methods "context" and "level" are only available with SELinux. This
      field cannot be blank.
    </para>

    <para>
      The fourth field, <replaceable>list_of_uids</replaceable>, is
      a comma separated list of user names for whom the polyinstantiation
      is not performed. If left blank, polyinstantiation will be performed
      for all users.
    </para>

    <para>
      In case of context or level polyinstantiation the SELinux context
      which is used for polyinstantiation is the context used for executing
      a new process as obtained by getexeccon. This context must be set
      by the calling application or <filename>pam_selinux.so</filename>
      module. If this context is not set the polyinstatiation will be
      based just on user name.
    </para>

    <para>
      The "instance differentiation string" is &lt;user name&gt; for "user"
      method and &lt;user name&gt;_&lt;raw directory context&gt; for "context"
      and "level" methods. If the whole string is too long the end of it is
      replaced with md5sum of itself. Also when command line option
      <replaceable>gen_hash</replaceable> is used the whole string is replaced
      with md5sum of itself.

    <title>EXAMPLES</title>
    <para>
      These are some example lines which might be specified in
      <filename>/etc/security/namespace.conf</filename>.
    </para>

    <literallayout>
      # The following three lines will polyinstantiate /tmp,
      # /var/tmp and user's home directories. /tmp and /var/tmp
      # will be polyinstantiated based on the security level
      # as well as user name, whereas home directory will be
      # polyinstantiated based on the full security context and user name.
      # Polyinstantiation will not be performed for user root
      # and adm for directories /tmp and /var/tmp, whereas home
      # directories will be polyinstantiated for all users.
      #
      # Note that instance directories do not have to reside inside
      # the polyinstantiated directory. In the examples below,
      # instances of /tmp will be created in /tmp-inst directory,
      # where as instances of /var/tmp and users home directories
      # will reside within the directories that are being
      # polyinstantiated.
      #
      /tmp     /tmp-inst/               level      root,adm
      /var/tmp /var/tmp/tmp-inst/   	level      root,adm
      $HOME    $HOME/$USER.inst/inst- context
    </literallayout>

    <para>
      For the &lt;service&gt;s you need polyinstantiation (login for example)
      put the following line in /etc/pam.d/&lt;service&gt; as the last line for
      session group:
    </para>

    <para>
      session  required  pam_namespace.so [arguments]
    </para>

    <para>
      This module also depends on pam_selinux.so setting the context.
