.SH "NAME"
pam_localuser \- require users to be listed in /etc/passwd
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 17
\fBpam_localuser.so\fR [debug] [file=\fI/path/passwd\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
pam_localuser is a PAM module to help implementing site\-wide login policies, where they typically include a subset of the network's users and a few accounts that are local to a particular workstation. Using pam_localuser and pam_wheel or pam_listfile is an effective way to restrict access to either local users and/or a subset of the network's users.
.PP
This could also be implemented using pam_listfile.so and a very short awk script invoked by cron, but it's common enough to have been separated out.
