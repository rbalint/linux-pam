Hello!

Thanks for downloading Linux-PAM.

NOTES:

How to use it is as follows:

      ./configure --help | less
      ./configure <your-options>
      make

To make sure everything was compiled correct, run:

      make check

If a test failes, you should not continue to install this build.

Note, if you are worried - don't even think about doing the next line
(most Linux distributions already support PAM out of the box, so if
something goes wrong with installing the code from this version your
box may stop working..)

      make install

That said, please report problems to the bug reporting database
on sourceforge.net.

You can run additional checks after installing by executing

      make xtests

as root.

If you do not wish to make the modules dynamically loadable, but
build a static libpam including all PAM modules, you have to call:

      ./configure --enable-static-modules

In this case you cannot use pam_unix in the PAM config files instead you
have to use pam_unix_acct, pam_unix_auth, pam_unix_passwd and
pam_unix_session.

To regenerate manual pages from the XML source files you need the
docbook-xsl stylesheets in version 1.69.1 or newer, older versions had
a bug which generates a broken layout.
