  * Default Unix minimum password length has changed

    Previous versions of pam_unix on Debian had a built-in minimum password
    length of 1 character, and a minimum password length configured in
    /etc/pam.d/common-password of 4 characters.  This differed from the
    upstream default of 6 characters.  This has been changed, so the
    default /etc/pam.d/common-password no longer overrides the compile-time
    default and the compile-time default has been raised to 6 characters.
    If you are using pam_unix but are not using the default
    /etc/pam.d/common-password file, it is recommended that you drop any
    min= options to pam_unix from your config unless you have stronger
    local password requirements that the upstream default.

    The password length 'max' option has also been deprecated in this
    version because it was never written to work as suggested in the
    documentation.  If you are using pam_unix but are not using the default
    /etc/pam.d/common-password file, you should remove any old max= options
    to pam_unix from your config as this option will be considered an error
    in future versions of pam.
