-----------------------------------

when calling the helper: call setuid(0) unconditionally?  (saves us a
syscall)

'nullok' is totally redundant in the passwd phase, and I never noticed
this :(

refactor passverify.c a bit more, helper_log_err() is used in places it 
doesn't need to be

longstanding goofiness (duplication) in the shadow verification code:

        if ((curdays - spent->sp_lstchg > spent->sp_max)
            && (curdays - spent->sp_lstchg > spent->sp_inact)
            && (curdays - spent->sp_lstchg > spent->sp_max + spent->sp_inact)


sepermit README.xml listed as 'entity pamaccess'?
sepermit example is SHIT!

go over all the XML and fix the English :P

unix_update should eventually support suid root operation as well,
maybe?
