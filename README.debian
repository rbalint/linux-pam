PAM for DEBIAN
--------------

PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) provides system administrators with a
powerful method of controlling system access and methods of authentication.

The documentation for PAM is packaged in the "libpam-doc" package. The
"Linux-PAM System Administrator's Guide" covers configuring PAM, what
modules are available etc. The documentation also includes "The Linux-PAM
Application Developers' Guide" and "The Linux-PAM Module Writers' Guide".

The Debian default configuration is to emulate the old UNIX authentication.

Changes Since Debian 3.0
------------------------

The pam_securetty module used to prompt for a password when it was
going to fail access.   This Debian-specific patch defeats one of the
key uses of this module: ot deny access to privileged accounts soon
enough in the PAM stack that  the password is never requested and is
not compromised over insecure network links.  If you want to ask for
the password use required not requisite in your PAM config.



Previously, pam_rhosts allowed the .rhosts file to be a symlink.  This
was a debian specific change that has been dropped because it is not
the upstream behavior nor is it the document behavior of ruserok(3).
